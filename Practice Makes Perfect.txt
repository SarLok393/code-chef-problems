Problem
Most programmers will tell you that one of the ways to improve your performance in competitive programming is to practice a lot of problems.

Our Chef took the above advice very seriously and decided to set a target for himself.

Chef decides to solve at least 10 problems every week for 4 weeks.
Given the number of problems he actually solved in each week over 4 weeks as P_1, P_2, P_3 and P_4P 

​
Output the number of weeks in which Chef met his target.

Input Format
There is a single line of input, with 44 integers P_1, P_2, P_3 and P_4​
These are the number of problems solved by Chef in each of the 44 weeks.

Output Format
Output a single integer in a single line - the number of weeks in which Chef solved at least 10 problems.

Sample 1:

Input-
12 15 8 10
Output-
3


Code - 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int arr[4];
	
	for(int i=0;i<4;i++){
	 cin>>arr[i];   
	}
	
	int counter = 0;
	for(int i=0;i<4;i++){
	    if(arr[i]>=10){
	        counter++;
	    }
	}
	cout<<counter;
	
	return 0;
}
