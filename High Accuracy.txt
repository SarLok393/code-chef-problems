Problem
There are 100 questions in a paper. Each question carries +3 marks for correct answer, -1 marks for incorrect answer and 0 marks for unattempted question.

It is given that Chef received exactly X (0 \leq X \leq 100)(0≤X≤100) marks. Determine the minimum number of problems Chef marked incorrect.

Input Format
First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single integer X, marks that Chef received.

Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of problems Chef marked incorrect.

Sample 1:

Input-
4
0
100
32
18

Output-
0
2
1
0

Code- 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	
	int T;
	cin>>T;
	
	while(T>0){
	    int X;
	    cin>>X;  // Marks that the Chef received 
	    
	    int W; // W = wrong answers (output)
	    
	    if(X%3==0){
	        W = 0;
	        cout<<W<<endl;
	    }
	    
	    else if(X%3==1){
	        W = 2;
	        cout<<W<<endl;
	    }
	    else if(X%3==2){
	        W = 1;
	        cout<<W<<endl;
	    }
	    
	    
	    T--;  
	}
	return 0;
