Problem-
Recently, Chef's College Examination has concluded. He was enrolled in 33 courses and he scored A, B, CA,B,C in them, respectively. 
To pass the semester, he must score at least Amin, Bmin, Cmin marks in the respective subjects along with a cumulative score of at least Tmin, 
i.e, A+B+C ≥ Tmin
​
Given seven integers Amin, Bmin, Cmin, Tmin, A, B, C tell whether Chef passes the semester or not.

Input:
The first line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, seven integers Amin, Bmin, Cmin, Tmin,A,B,C each separated by aspace.

Output:
Output in a single line, the answer, which should be "YES" if Chef passes the semester and "NO" if not.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).

Sample - 
Input:
5
1 1 1 300 2 2 2
3 2 2 6 2 2 2
2 3 2 6 2 2 2
2 2 3 6 2 2 2
100 100 100 300 100 100 100

Output:
NO
NO
NO
NO
YES

Code- 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int T;
	cin>>T;
	
	while(T>0){
	    
	    int Am,Bm,Cm; //minimum marks needed
	    cin>>Am>>Bm>>Cm;
	    
	    int Tm; //mimimum cumulative score
	    cin>>Tm;
	    
	    int A,B,C; // marks he scored
	    cin>>A>>B>>C;
	    
	    int total = A+B+C;
	    
	    if(A>=Am && B>=Bm && C>=Cm && total>=Tm) cout<<"YES"<<endl;
	    else cout<<"NO"<<endl;
	    
	    T--;
	}
	return 0;
}
